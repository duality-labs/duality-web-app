# duality-web-app

The code for the Duality front-end web app.

This version of the front end is intended to work with the release of the backend that is noted in the [@duality-labs/dualityjs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@duality-labs/dualityjs) dependency in package.json

## Setting up the dev environment

To set up the front end locally, connected to the current online testnet:

1. `$ npm install`
2. `$ npm start`
3. The dev site should become available at http://localhost:3000
4. Install/enable [the Keplr extension](https://github.com/chainapsis/keplr-wallet)
   on your browser
5. when you visit/refresh http://localhost:3000, allow the site to connect to
   the Duality testnet chain through Keplr prompt window that should appear
6. Select the Duality testnet chain on your Keplr extension
7. Add/select a valid Cosmos account on Keplr
8. If your account on Keplr has a bank balance on the Duality chain
   you will see that bank balance represented on your Keplr extension

### Connecting to a local backend with Docker Compose

1. Clone the [Duality Docker services repo](https://github.com/duality-labs/dualityd-docker-services) locally
   - this will also require cloning the main [Duality chain repo](https://github.com/duality-labs/duality)
2. Run the `docker compose up` commands as recommended there to bring up a locally running chain with exposed RPC and API ports
   - using the flag `--profile simulation` when composing this service should create a locally running chain cluster with simulated trading activity: this can help provide mock data for UI development
3. Edit your own .env.development.local file to change the backend ENV vars

   - `REACT_APP__REST_API=http://localhost:1317`
   - `REACT_APP__RPC_API=http://localhost:26657`
   - `REACT_APP__WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:26657/websocket`

   match these endpoints to your locally running chain cluster to develop against it.

   You can also use one of the MNENOMIC env vars in the Docker Compose file
   to add a new Keplr account (select "Import existing account") for local
   development

4. Start/restart your development server to use these new ENV vars:

   - `npm start`

   your development should now be making requests to your local backend

## Generated API types

The frontend connects to the backend through the backend API.
We use TypeScript types and API client code generated from the backend repo
.proto files and the
[@osmonauts/telescope](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@osmonauts/telescope)
package to help define the shape of the API for the frontend code base.
These files exist at https://github.com/duality-labs/dualityjs

The current backend repository version to use with the frontend
should be defined in the package.json file: here the version number of the
https://github.com/duality-labs/dualityjs dependency should represent
the corresponding backend API version number to use, see
https://github.com/duality-labs/duality/releases

## Deployed At

Current build of `main` should be available at https://app.dev.duality.xyz
